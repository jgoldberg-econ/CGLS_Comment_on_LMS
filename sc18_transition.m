% This function is identical to LMS's function of the same name, except
% that:
%
% (i) Lines 10-12 tell MATLAB to alter the guess for the investment
% success rates whenever the new discount rate is less than 50 basis
% points; when our code is executed, this condition will only be satisfied when
% calculating the transition dynamics following a decline in the discount
% rate from 3.59% to 0.33% (the decline in the discount rate in LMS's main
% calibration exercise).  Lines 10-12 imply that when solving for the BGP
% for a discount rate r = 0.33% , the guess for investment success rates is
% equal to the solution for investment success rates when solving for the r =
% 3.59% BGP.  This approach is very similar to how LMS make guesses when
% solving for the BGP at low discount rates (see Line 14 of their
% calibration_EMA_submit.m script).  This approach produces a BGP growth
% rate of 0.76% when r = 0.33%, the same as reported in their paper.  
% 
% (ii) Line 34 calculates \dot{Q}_F(t) under the Spillover from Leaders
% PDA (see our Online Appendix A.6).  Line 34 runs if PDA_leader == 1.
% This result is used only for our Figure IA.2.
%
% (iii) Lines 41-54 calculate the productivity growth composition effects
% in Equation IA.5 of our paper.  transg(t) corresponds to the change in the
% follower productivity index, \dot{Q}_F(t), in period t \in \{1,...,T\}.  
% dotmu0(t) is an approximation to  \dot{\mu}_0(t), the derivative of 
% the share of tied industries with respect to time.   
% transg_comp(t) is productivity growth at time t, taking into account
% composition effects.
